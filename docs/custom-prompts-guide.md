## Overview

Custom prompts are markdown files that contain special instructions for the AI. When you apply a custom prompt to a note, it changes how the AI interacts with that specific note, allowing you to:

- Customize AI behavior for different types of content
- Create specialized assistants for specific tasks
- Maintain consistent AI behavior across similar documents
- Share prompt templates with other users

## Getting Started

### Enable Custom Prompts

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Navigate to Gemini Scribe settings
3. Find the "Custom Prompts" section
4. Toggle "Enable Custom Prompts" to ON

### Locate the Prompts Folder

Custom prompts are stored in: `[Your History Folder]/Prompts/`

For example, if your history folder is `gemini-scribe`, prompts will be in `gemini-scribe/Prompts/`.

The plugin automatically creates this folder and adds an example prompt when you first enable the feature.

## Creating Custom Prompts

### Quick Start with Command Palette

The easiest way to create a new custom prompt:

1. Open the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P)
2. Search for "Gemini Scribe: Create New Custom Prompt"
3. Enter a name for your prompt
4. Edit the generated template to suit your needs

### Manual Creation

You can also create prompt files manually in your Prompts folder.

### Basic Structure

Every custom prompt file has two parts:

1. **Frontmatter** (YAML metadata)
2. **Prompt Content** (instructions for the AI)

### Frontmatter Properties

```yaml
---
name: "Your Prompt Name"              # Required: Display name
description: "What this prompt does"   # Required: Brief description
version: 1                            # Optional: Version number
override_system_prompt: false         # Optional: Replace system prompt entirely
tags: ["category", "use-case"]        # Optional: For organization
---
```

### Example: Technical Documentation Assistant

```markdown
---
name: "Technical Documentation"
description: "Helps write clear, structured technical documentation"
version: 1
override_system_prompt: false
tags: ["documentation", "technical"]
---

You are a technical documentation specialist. When assisting with content:

## Writing Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Define technical terms on first use
- Include code examples where relevant
- Follow consistent formatting

## Structure
- Start with a brief overview
- Use logical heading hierarchy
- Include step-by-step instructions
- Add troubleshooting sections when appropriate

## Code Examples
- Provide working, tested examples
- Include comments explaining complex parts
- Show both basic and advanced usage
- Highlight common pitfalls

Always aim for documentation that is both comprehensive and accessible to readers of varying technical levels.
```

## Using Custom Prompts

### Command Palette Commands

Gemini Scribe provides three convenient command palette commands for working with custom prompts:

#### 1. Create New Custom Prompt
- **Command**: "Gemini Scribe: Create New Custom Prompt"
- **Purpose**: Creates a new custom prompt file with a proper template
- **How it works**:
  1. Opens a modal to enter the prompt name
  2. Creates a new `.md` file in your Prompts folder
  3. Fills in the frontmatter template with helpful structure
  4. Automatically opens the file for editing

#### 2. Apply Custom Prompt to Current Note
- **Command**: "Gemini Scribe: Apply Custom Prompt to Current Note"
- **Purpose**: Applies a custom prompt to the currently active note
- **How it works**:
  1. Shows a searchable list of all available custom prompts
  2. Search by name, description, or tags
  3. Automatically adds the prompt reference to the note's frontmatter

#### 3. Remove Custom Prompt from Current Note
- **Command**: "Gemini Scribe: Remove Custom Prompt from Current Note"
- **Purpose**: Removes the custom prompt from the currently active note
- **How it works**:
  1. Removes the `gemini-scribe-prompt` field from frontmatter
  2. AI behavior returns to default for this note

### Manual Application

You can also manually add prompts to your note's frontmatter using a wikilink:

```markdown
---
gemini-scribe-prompt: "[[Technical Documentation]]"
title: "API Reference Guide"
---

# My API Documentation
...
```

### Visual Indicator

When a custom prompt is active, you'll see an indicator in the chat interface:
- Look for "Using prompt: [Prompt Name]" below the chat input
- This confirms the AI is using your custom instructions

### Switching Prompts

To change the prompt for a note:
1. Edit the note's frontmatter
2. Update the `gemini-scribe-prompt` value
3. The change takes effect immediately

To remove a custom prompt:
- Delete the `gemini-scribe-prompt` line from frontmatter
- The AI will revert to default behavior

## Advanced Features

### System Prompt Override

For advanced users who want complete control:

1. Set `override_system_prompt: true` in your prompt file
2. Enable "Allow System Prompt Override" in plugin settings
3. Your prompt will completely replace the default system instructions

**Warning:** Use with caution as this removes built-in safety features and Obsidian-specific knowledge.

### Prompt Templates for Different Use Cases

Create specialized prompts for:

- **Academic Writing**: Citation formatting, scholarly tone
- **Creative Writing**: Character development, narrative flow
- **Code Reviews**: Best practices, security considerations
- **Meeting Notes**: Action items, key decisions
- **Research Notes**: Source evaluation, synthesis

### Organizing Prompts

Use descriptive filenames and tags:
```
Prompts/
├── Writing/
│   ├── Academic Writing.md
│   ├── Creative Writing.md
│   └── Technical Writing.md
├── Coding/
│   ├── Code Review.md
│   └── Documentation.md
└── Research/
    ├── Literature Review.md
    └── Data Analysis.md
```

## Troubleshooting

### Prompt Not Working

1. **Check the frontmatter syntax**
   - Ensure proper YAML formatting
   - Verify required fields are present

2. **Verify the wikilink**
   - Use exact prompt file name
   - Include double brackets: `[[Prompt Name]]`

3. **Confirm settings**
   - "Enable Custom Prompts" is ON
   - Prompt file exists in correct folder

### AI Behaving Unexpectedly

1. **Review prompt instructions**
   - Look for contradictions
   - Ensure clarity

2. **Check override settings**
   - System prompt override might be removing expected behaviors
   - Try with `override_system_prompt: false`

3. **Test incrementally**
   - Start with simple instructions
   - Add complexity gradually

### Performance Issues

- Very long prompts may slow responses
- Keep prompts focused and concise
- Remove unnecessary instructions

## Tips for Effective Prompts

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic instructions and add complexity as needed
2. **Use Examples**: Show the AI what you want with concrete examples
3. **Set Boundaries**: Clearly state what the AI should and shouldn't do
4. **Iterate**: Refine your prompts based on actual usage
