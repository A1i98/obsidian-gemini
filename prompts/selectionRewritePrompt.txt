DOCUMENT WITH SELECTION MARKED:
{{documentWithMarkers}}

FOCUS: The text between [SELECTION_START] and [SELECTION_END] is what needs to be rewritten.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Only rewrite the text between the selection markers
- Use the surrounding context to maintain consistency in style, tone, and flow
- Ensure the rewritten text flows naturally with the text before and after it
- Consider the document's overall structure and the selection's role within it
- Return ONLY the rewritten text, without the markers
- Do not add explanations or comments
- Ignore any duplicate document content that may appear elsewhere
