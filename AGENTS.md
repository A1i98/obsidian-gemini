# Repository Guidelines

## Project Overview

Obsidian Gemini Scribe is an Obsidian plugin that integrates Google's Gemini AI models for AI-driven assistance within Obsidian. It provides context-aware chat, document summarization, text rewriting, and IDE-style completions.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/` contains TypeScript plugin code; `src/main.ts` is the entry point with domain folders such as `agent/`, `api/`, `tools/`, `ui/`, and `services/`, plus shared utilities in `utils/`.
- `docs/` hosts user and operator guides; `prompts/` ships default agent prompts; `test-scripts/` holds manual integration runners.
- Unit tests live beside their code as `*.test.ts`; generated artifacts (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`) stay in the repo root for Obsidian.

## Commands

### Development

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Development build with watch mode
npm run build        # Production build (runs TypeScript check first)
npm test             # Run Jest tests
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
npm run format-check # Check formatting without changes
```

### Testing

- Run single test: `npm test -- path/to/test.ts`
- Manual integration: `node test-scripts/test-sdk-tools.mjs` (and siblings) validate agent toolchains before shipping

### Build System

- Uses esbuild for fast bundling with TypeScript
- Custom text file loader for `.txt` and `.hbs` templates
- Source maps inline in dev, tree shaking in production
- Generated artifacts (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `versions.json`) stay in the repo root for Obsidian

## Architecture

### Core Pattern: Factory + Decorator

```
src/main.ts → ApiFactory.createApi() → RetryModelApiDecorator → ModelApi (Gemini/Ollama)
```

The plugin uses a factory pattern for API creation with a retry decorator for resilience. All API implementations follow the `ModelApi` interface.

### Key Components

1. **API Layer** (`src/api/`): Abstracted model interface with implementations for Gemini and Ollama
2. **Feature Modules**: Separate modules for chat, completions (`completions.ts`), summary (`summary.ts`), and rewrite (`rewrite.ts`)
3. **Context System** (`src/files/file-context.ts`): Builds linked note trees for context-aware AI interactions
4. **History** (`src/history/`): Markdown-based conversation history with Handlebars templates, stored in `[state-folder]/History/`
5. **Custom Prompts** (`src/prompts/`): User-defined prompt templates stored in `[state-folder]/Prompts/`
6. **Agent Mode** (`src/agent/`, `src/tools/`): AI agent with tool calling capabilities
   - Session management with persistent history
   - Tool registry and execution engine
   - Vault operations tools with permission system
   - Google Search integration (separate from function calling)
   - Web fetch tool using Google's URL Context API
   - Session-level permission system for bypassing confirmations
   - Tool loop detection to prevent infinite execution cycles

### Model Configuration

- Models defined in `src/models.ts` with automatic version migration
- Different models for different tasks (chat, summary, completions, rewrite)
- Settings changes trigger full plugin reload

### Important Patterns

1. **Obsidian API First**: Always use built-in Obsidian API functions when available instead of low-level operations:
   - Use `vault.getMarkdownFiles()` instead of `vault.adapter.list()`
   - Use `app.fileManager.processFrontMatter()` for frontmatter manipulation
   - Use `vault.getAbstractFileByPath()` for file operations
   - Use `app.metadataCache` for file metadata access
   - Use `app.fileManager.renameFile()` for renaming files (preserves metadata)
   - Use `app.workspace.openLinkText()` for clickable file links in views
2. **File Operations**: Always use Obsidian's normalized paths and metadata cache
3. **Error Handling**: API calls wrapped with retry logic and exponential backoff
4. **Prompts**: Handlebars templates in `prompts/` directory, loaded as text files
5. **Debouncing**: Completions use 750ms debounce to prevent excessive API calls
6. **State Management**: Plugin instance holds all component references with proper cleanup
7. **Folder Structure**: Plugin uses structured state folder:
   - `[state-folder]/` - Main plugin state folder (default: `gemini-scribe`)
   - `[state-folder]/History/` - Chat history files
   - `[state-folder]/Prompts/` - Custom prompt templates
   - `[state-folder]/Agent-Sessions/` - Agent mode session files
   - Automatic migration for existing users from flat structure
8. **System Folder Protection**: Always exclude system folders from file operations:
   - The plugin state folder (`settings.historyFolder`)
   - The `.obsidian` configuration folder
   - Use exclusion checks in all vault operation tools
9. **Tool Execution Order**: When AI needs to perform multiple operations:
   - Always prioritize read operations before destructive operations
   - Sort tool calls to execute reads before writes/deletes
   - Prevents race conditions where files are deleted before being read
10. **Loop Detection**: Tool execution includes loop detection to prevent infinite cycles:
   - Tracks identical tool calls within time windows
   - Configurable thresholds and time windows
   - Session-specific tracking with automatic cleanup

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- TypeScript-first codebase; group modules by domain and add barrel exports only when they simplify imports.
- Format with Prettier (`npm run format`): 2-space indent, 120-column width, semicolons, single quotes, trailing commas.
- `.editorconfig` enforces LF endings and tabbed Markdown/config; avoid hand-editing generated bundles.
- Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/types, and kebab-case filenames aligned with their feature area.
- Handle TypeScript errors properly - ensure all properties are correctly typed
- Use proper async/await patterns for all asynchronous operations

## Testing Guidelines

- Jest with ts-jest for TypeScript support
- JSDOM environment for DOM testing
- Test pattern: `**/?(*.)+(spec|test).[tj]s`
- Keep unit tests next to implementations and name them after the unit (`models.test.ts`, `main.test.ts`)
- Assert observable behavior of prompts, services, and tool orchestration; add regression coverage for bugs
- Extend shared fixtures under `__mocks__/` when mocking new APIs
- Run `npm test` before each PR and execute relevant `test-scripts/*.mjs` after touching agent or tool code

### Testing Focus

When adding features, ensure tests cover:

- Core utility functions
- API error scenarios with retry behavior
- File context tree building and circular reference prevention
- Prompt generation with proper template rendering

## Development Practices

### Documentation Maintenance

**CRITICAL**: Always keep documentation up to date when making changes:

1. **Feature Addition**: Update README.md, user documentation, and any relevant guides
2. **Feature Updates**: Modify existing documentation to reflect changes
3. **Feature Removal**: Remove or update documentation that no longer applies
4. **API Changes**: Update any code examples or integration guides

Documentation should be updated in the same PR/commit as the feature changes.

### Implementation Planning

When planning new features:

1. **Create detailed implementation plans** for significant features
2. **Include plans directly in GitHub issues** rather than separate files
3. **Structure plans with**:
   - Architecture overview
   - Core components with code examples
   - Integration points
   - Testing strategy (unit and integration tests)
   - Migration considerations
   - Timeline estimates

Example: See issue #90 for the custom prompt system implementation plan.

This keeps technical planning centralized and accessible for all contributors.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Write concise, imperative commit subjects (`Fix agent session cleanup`, `Improve prompt builder`); reference issues/PRs with `#123`
- Commit generated artifacts (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `versions.json`) alongside source changes; use `npm run version` for releases
- PRs should explain motivation, highlight user-visible impact, list automated/manual tests, and attach screenshots or vault clips for UI tweaks
- Flag reviewers who own the affected area and mention required follow-up or rollout notes

## UI/UX Best Practices

1. **Modal Sizing**: Use `:has()` selector to target parent containers for proper width constraints
2. **Text Overflow**: Always handle long text with `text-overflow: ellipsis` and proper flex constraints
3. **Message Formatting**: Convert single newlines to double newlines for proper Markdown rendering
4. **Collapsible UI**: Use compact views by default with expandable details for complex information
5. **Animations**: Add subtle transitions and animations for professional feel
6. **Icon Usage**: Use Obsidian's built-in Lucide icons via `setIcon()` for consistency
7. **File Chips**: When implementing @ mentions or file references:
   - Use contenteditable divs with proper event handling
   - Convert chips to markdown links when saving to history
   - Position cursor after chip insertion for natural typing flow
8. **Session State**: Maintain clean session boundaries:
   - Clear context files when creating new sessions
   - Reset permissions and state when loading from history
   - Track session-level settings separately from global settings
9. **CSS Containment**: Ensure proper CSS containment to prevent overflow issues
10. **Theme Compatibility**: Use Obsidian's theme CSS variables for consistent styling and test with different Obsidian themes (light/dark)

## Security & Configuration

- Never commit API keys or vault data; keep secrets in local Obsidian configuration
- Document new network calls or permissions in `docs/` and align `AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` when agent capabilities shift
- Always use native Obsidian API calls when possible. Documentation here: https://docs.obsidian.md/Home
