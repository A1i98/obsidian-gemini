# Gemini Scribe for Obsidian

Gemini Scribe is an Obsidian plugin that integrates Google's Gemini AI models, providing powerful AI-driven assistance for note-taking, writing, and knowledge management directly within Obsidian. It leverages your notes as context for AI interactions, making it a highly personalized and integrated experience.

> **Note:** This plugin requires a Google Gemini API key. Free tier available at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

## What's New

- **Dynamic Model Parameter Controls:** Automatic discovery of temperature and Top P ranges based on your available Gemini models with real-time validation
- **Advanced Settings Panel:** Developer-focused settings now organized in a dedicated section with improved discoverability
- **Model Discovery System:** Automatic fetching of the latest Gemini models with their parameter limits and capabilities
- **Enhanced API Configuration:** Configurable retry logic with exponential backoff for improved reliability
- **Enhanced Custom Prompts System:** Improved prompt management with better tracking and state handling
- **Improved Plugin Compatibility:** Replaced low-level file operations with native Obsidian APIs for better compatibility with other plugins
- **Better Chat History Integration:** Custom prompts are now properly tracked in chat history for better context continuity
- **Restructured Plugin State:** Cleaner organization of plugin data with automatic migration from older folder structures

## Features

- **Context-Aware Chat:** Engage in conversations with Gemini AI, with the ability to include the content of your current active note and its linked notes (up to a configurable depth) as context. This ensures highly relevant and personalized responses.
- **Smart Summarization:** Quickly generate concise, one-sentence summaries of your notes and automatically store them in the document's frontmatter, using a dedicated Gemini model optimized for summarization.
- **AI-Assisted Writing (with File Rewriting):** Collaborate with Gemini to draft, refine, and enhance your documents. When enabled, Gemini can directly modify your current note based on the conversation, providing a seamless writing experience.
- **IDE-Style Completions:** Get real-time, context-aware text completions as you type, similar to IDEs. Accept completions with `Tab` or dismiss with any other key. This feature uses a dedicated Gemini model for optimized completion generation.
- **Markdown-Based Chat History:** Store your chat history directly in your vault as markdown files. Each note's chat history is stored in a separate file in the `gemini-scribe/History/` folder, making it easy to backup, version control, and manage your AI interactions.
- **Configurable Models:** Choose different Gemini models for chat, summarization, and completions, allowing you to tailor the AI's behavior to each task.
- **Search Grounding (Optional):** Enhance responses with Google Search results, improving the accuracy and relevance of the information provided by the AI. A configurable threshold controls how likely search grounding is to be triggered.
- **Custom Prompt System:** Create reusable AI instruction templates that can be applied to individual notes, allowing you to customize the AI's behavior for different types of content (e.g., technical documentation, creative writing, tutoring). Includes command palette commands for easy creation, application, and removal of custom prompts.
- **Built-in Prompt Templates:** The plugin uses carefully crafted Handlebars templates for system prompts, general chat prompts, summarization prompts, rewrite prompts, completion prompts, and prompts to include the current date and time. These ensure consistent and effective AI interaction.
- **Data Privacy:** All interactions with the Gemini API are done directly from your machine. No data is sent to any third-party servers other than Google's. Chat history is stored locally in your Obsidian vault as markdown files.
- **Robust History Management:**
  - Per-note history files with automatic linking
  - Automatic handling of file renames and moves
  - Easy backup and version control of chat history
  - Commands to manage and clear history

    - Press any other key to dismiss the suggestion and continue typing.
5.  **Context-Aware:** Completions consider the surrounding text and document structure for more relevant suggestions.

### Chat History

- **Per-Note History:** Each note's chat history is stored in a separate markdown file in the configured history folder, making it easy to manage and backup.
- **View History:** Open the history file from the chat interface or navigate to `[History Folder]/[Note Name] - Gemini History.md`
- **Clear History:** Use the command palette to run "Gemini Scribe: Clear All Chat History" to remove all history files
- **Automatic Management:** The plugin automatically:
  - Creates history files when you start chatting about a note
  - Updates links when notes are renamed or moved
  - Preserves history across Obsidian sessions

### Custom Prompts

Create reusable AI instruction templates that customize how the AI behaves for specific notes.

1. **Enable Custom Prompts:** In plugin settings, ensure "Enable Custom Prompts" is toggled ON.

2. **Create New Prompts:**

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Errors:** Ensure your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions. Get a new key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
- **No Responses:** Check your internet connection and make sure your API key is valid.
- **Slow Responses:** The speed of responses depends on the Gemini model and the complexity of your request. Larger context windows will take longer.
- **Completions Not Showing:** 
  - Ensure completions are enabled via the command palette
  - Try typing a few words and pausing to trigger the suggestion
  - Check that you're in a Markdown file
  - Disable other completion plugins that might conflict
- **History Not Loading:** Ensure "Enable Chat History" is enabled and the "History Folder" is correctly set.
- **Custom Prompts Not Working:**
  - Ensure "Enable Custom Prompts" is toggled on in settings
  - Verify the prompt file exists in the Prompts folder
  - Check that the wikilink syntax is correct: `[[Prompt Name]]`
  - Try using the command palette commands for easier management
  - See the [Custom Prompts Guide](docs/custom-prompts-guide.md) for detailed troubleshooting
- **Parameter/Advanced Settings Issues:**
  - Check if your model supports the temperature range you're using
  - Reset temperature and Top P to defaults if getting unexpected responses
  - Enable model discovery to get latest parameter limits
  - See the [Advanced Settings Guide](docs/advanced-settings-guide.md) for detailed configuration help
