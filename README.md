# Gemini Plugin for Obsidian

This project integrates Google Gemini with Obsidian.

It provides three functions:

- A chat interface to interact with Gemini based on the context for the current active note.
- A summarization command to summarize the current active doc in one sentence and store the summary in the documents frontmatter.
- An experimental interface to write a doc in conjunction with the model. In this mode the model will overwrite the current active doc based on your interactions with the model.
